Another volume-centric indicator, the Klinger Oscillator
uses the concept of Volume Force which is a multiplicative
function across volume, price, and trend. Very similar
to On Balance Volume and the Chaikin Oscillator, the KO 
tries to predict a change in momentum from a majority
of sellers into a majority of buyers. In this case,
rather than a zero line, a Moving Average is used to 
generate signals. The KO line tends to have sharp
edges while its Moving Average is much smoother, when
the actual value [KO] crosses the average, a signal is
produced. Crossing the smooth average line with a negative
slope implies that buyers are losing momentum to sellers
which often leads to a decrease in price. The opposite
is true when the cross occurs with a positive slope.
