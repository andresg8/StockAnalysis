Similar to the On Balance Volume indicator, this 
oscillator visualizes the battle between buyers
and sellers of a stock. In this case, volume and
price direction are used to generate the estimated
momentum of volume support. The Chaikin Oscillator
produces Buy Signals it crosses up the zero line
into positive territory and Sell Signals when it crosses
down into negative territory. However, CO can often
confirm trends by showing positive slopes while
it's in positive territory [implying the uptrend is
strong] or by showing negative slopes while in negative
territory [implying the downtrend is strong].
