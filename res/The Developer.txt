My name is Andy Gonzalez, I have a Bachelors of Science
in Computer Science and Engineering from the University 
of California, Irvine. This app was made right after
graduation as a quick showcase project to demonstrate 
some of my programming abilities. To make it more fun
for myself, this app was written in Python
using the open source framework Kivy. Admittedly,
this app is far from a masterpiece but I hope,
and believe, it should be useful for anyone that has
a little patience for it. For any questions, comments,
or concerns please do not hesitate to reach me at
