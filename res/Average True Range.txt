A different mathematical approach to volatility, Average
True Range describes the range of prices a stock has 
been occupying in the given look-back period. 
A bigger ATR means a bigger range
of prices and thus more volatility. Strong up or down
trends are typically accompanied by increases in ATR.
Sudden changes in price that aren't then followed by
and increase in ATR are often failed trends meaning
that price will likely not continue to increase or
decrease as sharply.
