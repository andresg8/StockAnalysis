Volume is the total number of shares exchanged [buy OR sell] 
throughout a day. On Balance Volume intends to indicate
whether volume consisted of more buys than sells or vice
versa. It functions under the assumption that an increase
in price means a domination of buys over sells while
a decrease in price means a domination of sells over
buys. In this manner, the graph for On Balance Volume
demonstrates how strongly volume is working with
a change in price. The sharper the change in the OBV,
the stronger it's implied that volume is supporting
the change in price. On the other hand, sharp changes
in price without sharp changes in OBV can mean that
the trend is weak and thus unsustainable. Typically,
trends that are supported by volume are reliable so
if you want to invest in a stock and you see that volume
is on its side, you've got a good green light.
