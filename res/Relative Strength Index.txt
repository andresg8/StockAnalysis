The Relative Strength Index is a Statistic that aims
to signal when a stock is being overbought or oversold.
Identical to the idea seen in Bollinger Bands, where 
sharp movements towards the bands can signal an
incoming bounce-back, the RSI predicts these bounces
when the indicator shoots beyond a cap or drops below
a floor. Mathematically, the RSI is always a value
between 0 and 100. The cap is the red line towards
or at the top of the graph and represents a value of 70
while the floor is the red line near or at the bottom
and represents a value of 30. An RSI value above 70
or below 30 is considered statistically improbable and
thus suggests that the trend is more likely to reverse
than continue. Crossing the cap line [above 70]
signals a likely drop in the stock's price while
crossing the floor line [below 30] signals a likely
increase in the stock's price. Signals from the RSI
are rare and the values for cap and floor arguably
shouldn't be written in stone as 70 and 30 respectively.
It is sometimes enough for the RSI to reach an unusual
extreme [high or low], relative to its history, for it 
to signal that the price is about to change directions.
