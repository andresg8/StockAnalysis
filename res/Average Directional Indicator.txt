By far the most difficult statistic among these to
get right, the Average Directional Indicator (ADX)
is meant to indicate the strength of a trend. Split
into it's components, the red line indicates the 
strength of a downtrend while the green line indicates
the strength of an uptrend. Typically, when either
one is above the peach colored horizontal line, it means
their respective trend [+/-] is strong. A directional
indicator going up means the trend is strengthening
and the further above the peach line it is, the stronger
it is. However, a directional indicator coming down means
the trend is weakening so hitting a peak can often imply 
that the trend is about to reverse if it isn't already
doing so.
