Using the same statistical analysis tools available to
you through the Statistics function [as well minor in-house
analysis to filter noise], stocks are ranked daily 
based on how many Buy/Sell signals are present in 
their latest 2 Week span.

Ranking all stocks in existence and then displaying all
of them seemed like a silly idea so instead the function
allows you to search through industry/category and
in doing so allows for comparison within an industry.
