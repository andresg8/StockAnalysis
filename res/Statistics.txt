While very similar to Search, this function trades some
clarity and simplicity for the power of Statistical
Analysis. This function's graph displays any of the
listed statistical descriptors parallel to the stock's
price as well as any Buy/Sell signals associated with
the chosen statistic. 

Some stats can be tuned based on a look-back period
[the number to the stat's right]. In all cases a larger
look-back period means the stat will lag more and thus
produce "delayed" information [including signals].
Some argue, however, that this more delayed
information can provide stronger insight into the long
term
future of the stock. A smaller look-back period will
cause the stat to follow the stock's price more closely
and thus provide information much sooner. Admittedly,
however, this can lead to false positives more often
especially when the stock is stagnant. Wider ranges,
such as the 2-Year range, are often more informative
with longer look-back periods.

DISCLAIMER: Buy/Sell Signals are not personal recommendations
nor am I a clairvoyant. The produced signals are merely
visualizations of the statistical significances 
involved and are error prone if only due to the volatile
nature of the Stock Market. The strongest way to use this
tool is when there already exists a stock you'd like to
invest in; then, use the stats available to determine
the best time to buy shares. For detailed information
