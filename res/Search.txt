Search offers a clear view of a stock's price over
time with labels for the minimum, maximum, and average
found in the selected time frame. When available, Search
also provides fundamental information for understanding
the stock's business or operations.

Does a Search function really need a manual these days?
Could a manual describing Search really beat anyone's 
internal understanding of searching anymore? I don't think so
but I already told myself I'd write this so too bad.
