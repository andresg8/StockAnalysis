The Portfolios function allows you to simulate investments
in a stock and track the success of those investments as a
portfolio.

There's no option for number of shares to buy
because the focus is on the "Percent Change:" indicator.
This value establishes an even playing field among all
the stocks in the portfolio. Essentially, if a stock is
bought at $0.30 and its current value is $0.60, the
Percent Change is of 100% meaning investing in the
company would've doubled your money even if the change
in value is of $0.30 only. This same flat change on a
stock initially worth $3.00 results in a Percent Change
of 10% which is accurately reflective on the success
of the investment.

Perfect for practicing investment strategies, this
function works best in tandem with the Statistics
function. Are you seeing buy signals or patterns you
like but you're still not sure you can commit money on
them? Test your ideas with this function and soon enough
you'll be confident enough to start making money!
